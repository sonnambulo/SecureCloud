These are a few examples of some APIs that are available from SecureCloud (Kubernetes only)
There is a swagger reference for the SecureCloud APIs here. https://securecloud.tufin.io/api-documentation/index.html

Each bash script will prompt you for the login information to your SecureCloud tenant and will then pull the required access token to perform the API.

Tenant name:

    The name of your tenant. Available from your SecureCloud url i.e. https://campbell-systems.securecloud.tufin.io/ tenant name would be 'campbell-systems'

Project name

    The name of your cluster / project which is provided in the upper left hand menu bar of secure cloud - by default all tenants have one project called 'my-project'

Username: 

    The email address you use to log into your SecureCloud tenant

Password:

    The password used to log into your SecureCloud tenant.
